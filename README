NAME

    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Fortran - Documentation and tools for using
    Platypus with Fortran

SYNOPSIS

    TODO

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides native types and demangling for Fortran when used
    with FFI::Platypus.

    This module is somewhat experimental. It is also available for adoption
    for anyone either sufficiently knowledgable about Fortran or eager
    enough to learn enough about Fortran. If you are interested, please
    send me a pull request or two on the project's GitHub.

CAVEATS

    TODO

METHODS

    Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting
    with the FFI::Platypus instance. However, the public methods used by
    Platypus are documented here.

 native_type_map

     my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Fortran->native_type_map;

    This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for
    Fortran. That is the keys are native Fortran types and the values are
    libffi native types.

 mangler

     my $mangler = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Fortran->mangler($ffi->libs);
     my $c_name = $mangler->($fortran_name);

    Returns a subroutine reference that will "mangle" Fortran names.

SUPPORT

    If something does not work as advertised, or the way that you think it
    should, or if you have a feature request, please open an issue on this
    project's GitHub issue tracker:

    https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Fortran/issues

CONTRIBUTING

    If you have implemented a new feature or fixed a bug then you may make
    a pull reequest on this project's GitHub repository:

    https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Fortran/pulls

    Also Feel free to use the issue tracker:

    https://github.com/plicease/FFI-Platypus-Lang-Fortran/issues

    This project's GitHub issue tracker listed above is not Write-Only. If
    you want to contribute then feel free to browse through the existing
    issues and see if there is something you feel you might be good at and
    take a whack at the problem. I frequently open issues myself that I
    hope will be accomplished by someone in the future but do not have time
    to immediately implement myself.

    Another good area to help out in is documentation. I try to make sure
    that there is good document coverage, that is there should be
    documentation describing all the public features and warnings about
    common pitfalls, but an outsider's or alternate view point on such
    things would be welcome; if you see something confusing or lacks
    sufficient detail I encourage documentation only pull requests to
    improve things.

    Caution: if you do this too frequently I may nominate you as the new
    maintainer. Extreme caution: if you like that sort of thing.
